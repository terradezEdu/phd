PhD. thesis: Transference learning in crowd simulation
Tutor: Prof. Francisco Martinez Gil
Author: Eduardo García Terrádez

In the last years, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) combined with 3D simulations has achieved significant advances in healthcare, pharmacy, automation, robotics, etc. This is the case of self-driving cars, alphafold and so on.  

In this thesis, we will research DRL architectures in crowd simulation. For this proposal, we will design different environments in Unity and set several agents to recreate a high-density situation, where an easier task like leaving a room without collision with walls, objects and other agents could be complicated.

¡Still working on it!
